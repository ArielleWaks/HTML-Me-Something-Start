            <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">I haven&#039;t always appreciated the Ashkenazi Jewish food I grew up with. It was not as colorful or spicy as the food my friends&#039; parents would serve. The yiddish words can sound similar to someone clearing her throat. But the more I have learned about Ashkenazi cuisine, the more I see how the dishes carry stories of resilience, culture, and celebration.</p>
